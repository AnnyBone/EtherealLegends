Ethereal Legends - An Indie Action RPG built with Unreal Engine 4.

Ethereal Legends Module for UE4

This module is provided as is, and is not intended to be a complete, working game. Instead, this module is meant to be used as a learning resource for others looking to bring their UE4 games to C++.

While I'd love to completely open-source Ethereal Legends, much of my code is currently in UE4's Blueprint system, and of course I do not have the rights to redistribute any of the assets I've used to create the game. So this repository is the best I can do, providing you with the direct source I've used to build the game.

In the future as the game gets closer to release, I'd like to work in the wiki section and build the documentation to allow other people to help continue development. If you find something in the game that you'd like to add or change, feel free to make a pull request and I'll work to integrate it into the game. Successful pull requests will have their names added to the in-game credits!
